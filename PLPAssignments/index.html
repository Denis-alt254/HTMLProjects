            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Right now, I’m pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, where I'm learning everything from algorithms to software design. The combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on projects has given me a strong foundation in the basics of development. I’m always looking to go beyond the classroom, exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to stay adaptable in an ever-changing industry. I also enjoy participating in coding challenges, hackathons, and side projects that help me sharpen my skills and learn in a practical way.</p>

        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>Although I’m still studying, I’ve already gained some hands-on experience through personal projects, internships, or contributing to open-source projects. These experiences have allowed me to improve my coding skills and learn more about working in a collaborative environment. I've built applications and tools that show my proficiency in coding, software architecture, and problem-solving. While my professional experience is still developing, I’m confident in my ability to continue growing, learning, and taking on new challenges as I build my career.</p>
